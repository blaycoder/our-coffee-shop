# A coffee shop website

This is a coffee shop website that was created using HTML, CSS, Javascrip and Bootstrap. I was given an ultimatum to create the website. I had to make use of a template onlin
in order to save my time since I am no more a beginner using the above tools. I had to tweak the template to work in my own way, I had to do many changes on the original template used.

### My challenges
The only challenge I had was when I tried fitting all the carousel images to have the same width in the carousel, I was able to fix it after going through stackflow.
